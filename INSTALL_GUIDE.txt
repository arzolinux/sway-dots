# Dotfiles Installation Guide for Sway on Arch Linux

This guide will help you install and set up these dotfiles after installing base Sway on Arch Linux.

## Prerequisites
- Arch Linux installed with base Sway setup
- Basic Sway installation: `pacman -S sway wayland xorg-server-xwayland`
- Internet connection

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the dotfiles repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME ~/.dotfiles
   cd ~/.dotfiles
   ```

2. **Make the install script executable**
   ```
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

3. **Run the installation script**
   ```
   ./install.sh
   ```
   The script will:
   - Ask for your sudo password
   - Install required packages (waybar, starship, tmux, neovim, etc.)
   - Create symlinks for configuration files
   - Copy wallpapers to ~/Pictures/
   - Install tmux plugins via TPM

4. **Apply the changes**
   - Logout from your current session
   - Login again to Sway
   - Alternatively, from a TTY: `swaymsg exit` then `sway` (but this may require running the script before starting Sway)

## What's included
- **Waybar**: Status bar configuration with workspaces, audio, battery, etc.
- **Starship**: Shell prompt customization
- **Tmux**: Terminal multiplexer with plugins (catppuccin theme, vim navigation, yank, etc.)
- **Neovim**: Text editor (configuration directory ready for your setup)
- **Wallpapers**: Background images

## Customization
- Edit the configuration files in the repository
- The symlinks will automatically reflect changes
- For tmux plugins, add/remove from tmux.conf and run `~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/bin/install_plugins`

## Troubleshooting
- If packages fail to install, ensure your Arch system is up to date: `pacman -Syu`
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- For Sway-specific issues, refer to the Sway documentation
